## Open Source

### ERC-1363 Payable Token

```
ERC1363 is an extension interface for ERC20 tokens that supports executing code on a recipient contract after transfers, or code on a spender contract after approvals, in a single transaction.
ERC1363 tokens can be used for specific utilities in all cases that require a callback to be executed after a transfer or an approval received. 
ERC1363 is also useful for avoiding token loss or token locking in contracts by verifying the recipient contract's ability to handle tokens.
